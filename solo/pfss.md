title: Solar Orbiter and PSP connection predictions
exclude: true
---

This page contains magnetic connection predictions for Solar Orbiter and
Parker Solar Probe. Currently these span from the launch of Parker Solar Probe to
today + 14 days.

They assume a solar wind speed of 350 km/s, down to a source surface at 2.5 solar
radii. Below that the trajectory is traced through a PFSS model based on a GONG
synoptic magnetogram. I hope to update the movie on a daily basis with new GONG
magnetographs and AIA images.
