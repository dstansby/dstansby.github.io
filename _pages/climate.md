We all know the climate is changing. In the UK we probably won't *directly* feel the worst of these changes, but I'm still interested in how the climate is changing where I live.

All data was [recorded at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/how-the-weather-is-recorded-at-cubg/), and has generously been made available under the [Open Government License](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). It's part of the [MIDAS Open dataset](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4982-midas-open-user-guide), "a collection of observation datasets made available by the Met Office each year under the Open Government Licence".

2020 is drawn in green 2021 in black. Previous years are draw in the background going back in time from red to blue. Hover over a line to see the year it represents.
