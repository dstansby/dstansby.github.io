This is a list of medium - large sized projects that I would like to work on, but don't currently have funding for.

### Building accesibility into `matplotlib` windows
- [MacOSX backend windows have no accessibility data](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24608)

### Making `astropy.units` work with type hints
