This is a list of medium - large sized projects that I would like to work on, but don't currently have funding for.
If you know where I can get funding from to buy out my time for these, please let me know!
As long as the money can be sent to UCL, I should be able to work on them as part of my day job.

### Building accessibility into `matplotlib` windows
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) has a number of interactive [backends](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/backends.html) that allow users to interact with plots.
So far no-one has done an accessibility audit on these backends - is it possible for users with accessibility requirements to use them, and if not what needs to happen?

This project would carry out an accessibility audit, and use the results to work on making interactive plotting in Matplotlib accessible.

Relevant issues:
- [MacOSX backend windows have no accessibility data](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24608)


### How much CO2 does running CI on open source projects emit?
