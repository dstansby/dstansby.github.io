This is a list of medium - large sized projects that I would like to work on, but don't currently have funding for.

### Building accesibility into `matplotlib` windows
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) has a number of interactive [backends](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/backends.html) that allow users to interact with plots.
So far no-one has done an accesibility audit on these backends - is it possible for users with accesibility requirements to use them, and if not what needs to happen?

This project would carry out an accesibility audit, and use the results to work on making interactive plotting in Matplotlib accesible.

Relevant issues:
- [MacOSX backend windows have no accessibility data](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24608)


### How much CO2 does running CI on open source projects emit?

### Making `astropy.units` work with type hints

Relevant issues:
- [Compound units are not valid type annotations](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/14134)
- [`quantity_input` decorator is un-typed](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/14110)
