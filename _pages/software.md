I have a long history of contributing to open source software, especially in the scientific Python ecosystem.

# Current projects

## [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
This is where I stated my adventure in open source.
I filed my first feature request [in April 2016](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6272), opened my first pull request [in May 2016](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/6369), and became a maintainer in January 2017.
Since then I've done a wide range of **fixing bugs, triaging issues, adding new features, and improving documentation**.
I am currently one of the handful of active maintainers.

## [napari](https://napari.org/stable/)
I'm currently working on adding typing to napari, to reduce technical debt and increase maintainability.
I've also contributed issue reports and pull requests for various packages within the plugin ecosystem.

## [Public Utility Data Liberation project (pudl)](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/)
`pudl` is a project to make publicly available data publicly *usable*, by cleaning and standardising data from different sources in a single database.
I started contributing in mid-2023 through a desire to apply my open source experience to a climate focused area.
So far I have focused on improving the performance of the data pipelines by parallelising data ingestion from multiple sources.

# Past projects
These are all projects I created, maintained, and developed during my 6 years as a solar physics researcher.

## [sunpy](https://sunpy.org/)
I started contributing to sunpy in [Nov 2017](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2289), became a **maintainer** shortly after that, helping see sunpy through from the transition to the fist stable version (v1.0).
I've done a **major re-write** of the core ``Map`` class, added support for reading widely used file formats, made significant performance improvements across the library, and contributed many other bug fixes and issue reports.

More recently, I was the **release manager** for two years. I no longer contribute code or do much code review.

## [pfsspy](https://pfsspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
Potential Field Source Surface modelling is the most popular way to model the magnetic field of the Sun.
Despite this there was no documented, open source tool to do this modelling, until I **created** pfsspy in 2019.
Since then it has been [used in almost 50 papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/hfLAIo9DQw6yuNlLkn40GQ), including some of the key results from NASA's flagship [Parker Solar Probe](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/) and ESA's flagship [Solar Orbiter](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter) missions.

## [HelioPy](https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy)
This is the first package I built from the ground up myself, to fill a gap for  doing data science with Heliospheric datasets.
I eventually sunsetted HelioPy, as I didn't do a very good job of building a contributor community around it.
Instead I focused my efforts on helping sunpy support heliospheric data analysis.
