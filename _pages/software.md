I have a long history of contributing to open source software, especially in the scientific Python ecosystem.
Below is a list of packages I've worked on.

# General purpose
## [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
This is where I stated my adventure in open source. I filed my first feature request [in April 2016](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6272), opened my first pull request [in May 2016](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/6369), and became a maintainer in January 2017. Since then I've done a wide range of fixing bugs, triaging issues, adding new features, and improving documentation. I am not currently an active maintainer, but still occasionally open bug reports and review pull requests.

Recently I have taken on some freelance work to add new features to the interactive widgets. If there are larger features you're interested in seeing added, I'm currently open to taking on small freelance projects.

## [napari](https://napari.org/stable/)
I've contributed issue reports and pull requests for various packages within the plugin ecosystem of [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), a multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.

# Solar Physics

## [sunpy](https://sunpy.org/)
I started contributing to sunpy in [Nov 2017](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2289), became a maintainer shortly after that, and helped see sunpy through from the transition to the fist stable version (v1.0).

I am currently the release manager. I've previously undertaken major re-writing of the core ``Map`` class, added support for reading widely used file formats, and made significant performance improvements.

## [pfsspy](https://pfsspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
Potential Field Source Surface modelling is the most popular way to model the magnetic field of the Sun.
Despite this there was no documented, open source tool to do this modelling, until I created pfsspy in 2019.
Since then it has been [used in almost 50 papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/hfLAIo9DQw6yuNlLkn40GQ), including some of the key results from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter missions.

## [HelioPy](https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy)
This is the first package I built from the ground up myself, to fill a gap for  doing data science with Heliospheric datasets.
I eventually sunsetted HelioPy, as I didn't do a very good job of builing a contributor community around it.
Instead I focused my efforts on helping sunpy support heliospheric data analysis.
