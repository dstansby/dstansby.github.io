I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [solar](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/solar-physics)
and [space plasma](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/space-plasma-physics)
physics groups at the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/).

My research
-----------
My primary research interest is linking in-situ measurements of the solar wind
with remote sensing observations of the Sun to learn about processes that
create, heat, and accelerate the solar wind. For a list of all my publications,
see [this ADS link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/699B06FhTXeD-hhNZN-mbQ).

Solar Orbiter & PSP tools
-------------------------
I'm also involved in making tools that help others do science with new data.
Here's a selection of tools I have made for Solar Orbiter and PSP:

- [Solar Orbiter Data Availability](https://www.davidstansby.com/soda/) (SODA):
  a quick-look tool to see which data products are available on which days from
  Solar Orbiter.

- [`sunpy-soar`](https://github.com/dstansby/sunpy-soar): a python interface to
  the Solar Orbiter archive (SOAR).

- [Oribt movies](https://www.davidstansby.com/PSP/orbit_movies.html): movies
  of Solar Orbiter and PSP orbits in different coordinate systems.

- [Connection predictions](https://www.davidstansby.com/solo/pfss.html): magnetic
  connection predictions for Solar Orbiter and PSP, along with synoptic EUV maps
  and magnetograms.
