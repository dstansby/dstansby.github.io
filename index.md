I am a research postgraduate in the [Space and Atmospheric Physics Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/space-and-atmospheric-physics) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research is focused on in-situ measurements of the solar wind, and what these can tell us about fundamental plasma physics.
Current research interests include:
- The evolution of electron populations in the solar wind
- Fine scale structure of the solar wind
- Linking in-situ measurements of the solar wind to remote sensing measurements of the sun
