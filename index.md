# In brief
I am a **Research Software Engineer** in UCL's
[Center for Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/) (ARC), writing software for a wide
spectrum of research groups across the university.

Before that I researched the physics of the Solar Wind, our Sun's
atmosphere that stretches from the solar surface to beyond the orbit of
Pluto:
- **Research Fellow** (2019 - 2022) in the
[solar physics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/solar-physics)
at the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/).
- **PhD** at Imperial College London (2015 - 2019),


I'm also walking around England - here's my progress so far:
