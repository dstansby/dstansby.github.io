I enjoy walking, especially linking up multiple days on long distance trails.
I've walked:

- London's [Capital Ring](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/capital-ring) (~Zones 2-3 on foot)
- The [London Outer Orbital Ring](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/loop-walk) (~the M25 on foot).

I'm currently walking:
- The Thames Path (currently completed from the Thames Barrier to Oxford)
- The South West Coast Path (almost completed the whole South coast)

Eventually I'd like to keep going on the coast path and walk around the border
of England, linking up the coast with the Offa's Dyke Path along the Welsh
border and Hadrian's Wall along (almost) the Scottish border. Here's my progress so
far:
