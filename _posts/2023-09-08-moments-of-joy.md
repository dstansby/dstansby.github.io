There's something wrong with my lungs, which is most likely cancer. Which is shit. It seems like I'm going to go through a lot in hospital over the next few months.

In amongst it all, there have already been moments of joy. And I wanted to log them here so I remember them. I'll keep updating this post with new ones as they happen ðŸ˜Š

- Taking a breathing test, glancing at the graph on the recording device, and immediately knowing I hadn't followed the instructions properley. On the third try I got a grade A and the graph looked pretty fine though!
- Once I've had a PET-CT scan, I'll be too radioactive to see pregnant people for six hours afterwards.
- "The main side effect is boredom in the hour long relaxation stage!"
