At Imperial I taught 2nd year tutorials for a few years. Below are a collection
of python notebooks illustrating a couple of the undergraduate tutorial problems:

### Statistics of measurement
Problem sheet 2 APS - [HTML](notebooks/calculating_variance.html)), [python notebook](https://github.com/dstansby/notebooks/blob/master/Calculating%20variance.ipynb)
### Solid state
Problem sheet 3 APS - [HTML](notebooks/lattice_vibrations.html), [python notebook](https://github.com/dstansby/notebooks/blob/master/Lattice%20vibrations.ipynb)
